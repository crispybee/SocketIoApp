# SocketIoApp

This app connects with a node socket.io server.

## Setup
Just run the app (alongside the (node-data-collector)[https://git.mi.hs-heilbronn.de/wifi-vs/node-data-collector]) in the Android emulator or on an Android phone in the same local network.
The app connects to "http://10.0.2.2:3000", which is the localhost at port 3000.
